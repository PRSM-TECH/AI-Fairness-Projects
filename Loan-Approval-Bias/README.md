AI Fairness & Bias Mitigation Projects

ðŸš€ This repository contains AI projects focused on Bias Detection, Fairness Mitigation, and AI Governance. The goal is to create ethical AI systems that ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance with responsible AI guidelines.


ðŸ“Œ 1. Loan Approval Bias Project

Objective: Detect and address racial bias in AI-based loan approvals.

Key Features:

Uses Random Forest Classifier for loan approval prediction.

Computes Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) to assess fairness.

Investigates bias effects based on race.

ðŸ“œ Usage:

python loan_bias_analysis.ipynb


ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

AI Fairness & Bias Detection: Fairlearn, AI Explainability (SHAP, LIME)

Machine Learning & Model Audits: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

No-Code AI Automation: RPA, AI Model Monitoring

Data Processing & Analysis: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters?

AI models must be fair, transparent, and unbiased to ensure they benefit all communities without discrimination. This repository helps in understanding how to audit, evaluate, and improve AI models with fairness in mind.
