AI Fairness & Bias Mitigation Projects

ðŸš€ This repository contains AI projects focused on Bias Detection, Fairness Mitigation, and AI Governance. The goal is to create ethical AI systems that ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance with responsible AI guidelines.

ðŸ“Œ 1. Hiring Bias Project

Objective: Identify and mitigate gender bias in AI hiring models.

Key Features:

Uses Logistic Regression to predict hiring decisions.

Evaluates Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) to check fairness.

Demonstrates bias impact based on gender.

ðŸ“œ Usage:

python hiring_bias_analysis.ipynb


ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

AI Fairness & Bias Detection: Fairlearn, AI Explainability (SHAP, LIME)

Machine Learning & Model Audits: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

No-Code AI Automation: RPA, AI Model Monitoring

Data Processing & Analysis: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters?

AI models must be fair, transparent, and unbiased to ensure they benefit all communities without discrimination. This repository helps in understanding how to audit, evaluate, and improve AI models with fairness in mind.
