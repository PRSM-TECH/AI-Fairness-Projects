AI Fairness & Bias Mitigation Projects

ðŸš€ This repository contains AI projects focused on Bias Detection, Fairness Mitigation, and AI Governance. The goal is to create ethical AI systems that ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance with responsible AI guidelines.


ðŸ“Œ 1. Healthcare Bias Project

Objective: Ensure fairness in AI-driven healthcare diagnosis systems.

Key Features:

Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify medical diagnoses.

Measures Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) for fairness evaluation.

Detects bias against minority ethnic groups.

ðŸ“œ Usage:

python healthcare_bias.ipynb

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

AI Fairness & Bias Detection: Fairlearn, AI Explainability (SHAP, LIME)

Machine Learning & Model Audits: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

No-Code AI Automation: RPA, AI Model Monitoring

Data Processing & Analysis: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters?

AI models must be fair, transparent, and unbiased to ensure they benefit all communities without discrimination. This repository helps in understanding how to audit, evaluate, and improve AI models with fairness in mind.
